# The Library

The library is intended to be a platform for organizing personal collections
of various types.

Beginning with a focus on books, the idea is to create a hub for individuals
to organize their own libraries of books, music, videos, photos, games and more.
With the ability to sort and search across different collections in one place, it
opens the door to finding missign items from your collection, buying, selling,
trading, borrowing and loaning with other collectors.
